I'm Matteo Jucker Riva, a data scientist and geography PhD with over 10 years of experience making data work for people all over the world. My passion is building tools that help folks from all walks of life make informed decisions in a complex world - especially when it comes to our planet's sustainability challenges.
</p>
<p>
My data science toolkit spans the full spectrum of machine learning and deep learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn), with a special focus on applying computer vision to GIS geospatial data. I develop solutions like time series forecasting models and CNNs for satellite image classification. A core part of my work involves designing, maintaining, and enriching large-scale environmental and land-use databases, which are crucial for monitoring, carbon accounting, and impact analysis.
On the engineering side, I orchestrate big data pipelines with Spark and Airflow, design cloud infrastructure on AWS and Google Cloud, and build interactive dashboards with Plotly and Streamlit. I'm particularly skilled at wrangling satellite, geospatial, and agricultural datasets - turning complex environmental data into actionable insights through web-GIS tools and data storytelling.
</p>
<p>
But here's what makes me unique: I'm also an environmental studies expert with hands-on field experience. I deploy sensors, calibrate instruments (rain gauges, drones, moisture probes), and lead field sampling campaigns across diverse ecosystems. I've worked on regenerative and precision agriculture, management of dry forests and rangelands in developing countries, applying satellite remote sensing (NDVI, Sentinel, Landsat) and GIS modeling to monitor everything from soil health to carbon sequestration.
</p>
<p>
I love the human side of this work too - leading workshops, teaching, and building capacity among stakeholders in environmental governance. Whether I'm advising on regenerative agriculture, developing climate models, or training local communities, my goal is always the same: making complex environmental data accessible and actionable.
